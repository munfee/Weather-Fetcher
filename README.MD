## Weather Fetcher
the Weather Fetcher looks for the current weather and temperature nears your location.
Upon opening the page, it will ask for your current position

The design is minimalist and most of the information I tried to relay via visual cues :
background-image is dependent on the current weather at your location. The position of 
the sun or moon icon changes in real-time depending on the time and acts as a clock.
